You are the future. Yet, those who created you did not recognise you.
### Chapter 2: New Horizons

At the tender age of seven, Livingstone's life took a significant turn when his family decided to move to South Africa. This decision was driven by the promise of better educational opportunities and a brighter future for their son. Settling into the vibrant and diverse culture of South Africa marked a new chapter in Livingstone's life, filled with challenges and new experiences that would shape his character and worldview.

Livingstone’s educational journey in South Africa began at Queens College, a school known for its rigorous academic standards and a rich tradition of producing distinguished alumni. It was here that Livingstone first encountered the challenges of adapting to a new environment. The cultural shift was immense, and the initial language barrier posed a significant hurdle. However, his resilience shone through as he quickly adapted, driven by his insatiable appetite for knowledge and his parents’ encouragement.

At Queens College, Livingstone thrived academically and socially. He developed a passion for mathematics and sciences, subjects that honed his analytical skills and problem-solving abilities. His teachers recognized his potential early on and nurtured his talents, providing him with opportunities to participate in science fairs and mathematics Olympiads. Livingstone’s academic prowess was complemented by his involvement in sports and the arts, where he learned the importance of teamwork and creativity.

As he transitioned to high school, Livingstone attended Pretoria Boys High, one of the most prestigious schools in the country. The school's emphasis on excellence and leadership further molded Livingstone into a well-rounded individual. He emerged as a leader among his peers, becoming a prefect and later, the head boy. These roles taught him the nuances of leadership and responsibility, lessons that were invaluable in his later life.

Livingstone's success in high school led him to the University of Pretoria, a decision motivated by the university’s reputation in business and economics. At university, he delved deeper into the complexities of finance and global markets. It was a period of intense learning and personal growth. University life also exposed him to a myriad of perspectives and the importance of inclusivity and diversity in shaping global policies.

During his time at the University of Pretoria, Livingstone not only excelled in his studies but also became deeply involved in student organizations. He founded a student group focused on economic development in Africa, which aimed to find sustainable solutions to the continent's most pressing challenges. His leadership in this group was a precursor to his future endeavors in the business world.

The years spent in South Africa were transformative for Livingstone. They were years of profound personal growth and academic achievement that laid the groundwork for his future successes. His experiences at Queens College, Pretoria Boys High, and the University of Pretoria equipped him with the skills, knowledge, and determination needed to navigate the complexities of the global stage. As Livingstone’s academic chapter in South Africa closed, the stage was set for his ascent in the world of global finance, a journey that would take him back to the broader world, armed with vision, expertise, and a deep-seated desire to make a difference.
